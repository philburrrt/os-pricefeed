# OpenSea floor price feed

## Run

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. ```pip install pandas``` 
1.  ```py openseaPrice.py``` or ```python3 openseaPrice.py```

## Usage

Edit the approvedListings.json file to your liking.

You can give the collection any name, but it needs the /slug from opensea. i.e. opensea.io/collection/**milady**

Data refreshed every 15-20 seconds directly from Opensea's API. I keep it up in a small terminal on my monitor. 

Planning on turning it into a lightweight website with py-scripts? I dunno. Going to keep building it in my free time.
